# Kashgari Task

**Project link**: https://kashgari-task.vercel.app/

## How it's made

Used **shadcn/ui** for a component library for beautiful yet simple style. Used **maplibre-gl** library for rendering the map. Used **nominatim** API for searching the location's longitude and latitude. Used **zod** for schema validation (used with form).

## Difficulties

At the demo I saw 3d map and was curious which library is it. I considered three options: google maps API, maplibre-gl, mapbox-gl. At first I tried google maps API and it was okay. But I don't know why but I wanted to try something opensource lol. Then I was choosing between maplibre and mapbox and considered maplibre as a better choice because its open-source and have different map styles.

## Appreciation

It was fun working on this project because I didn't expect that simple expense tracker could be this interesting. Learned a lot of new things. Really appreciate the opportunity to work on this project. I mostly worked with NextJS and it was fun working only on client-side code.
